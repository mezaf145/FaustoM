# Conflict's Sanity

## Overview
This is a story based text horror adventure game. The player will play through
the story of a journalist exploring an abandoned town. The player needs to manage
the journalist's sanity level, so he wouldn't go insane(game over), by making 
decisions that may or may not cost you to lose the game. It will consist of 
different options and results depending on decision making. Different objects 
will be interactable in the game to answer more storyline questions/mysteries,
and images and sound will paint a picture in the player's mind so that the player
can feel like they are in the game.

## Background
There are many horror games that try to give an uncomfortable feeling to the 
player using images and sounds. If you try to find
a good horror game, they are usually constructed with fancy graphics and are usually
overpriced. Though, if you manage to find an affordable
game, it's usually mediocre in terms of scaring someone with cheesy jumpscares
that will get old throughout the game.

I came with a solution to resolve this problem in the electronic world. I've seen
many horror movies and horrific things in life, therefore 
I believe I have a good eye for what is truly scary and what is not. It will take a lot 
of effort to make this work, scary, and have an interesting story simultaneously.

## Significance 
This project will touch on keeping track of different possible endings the player
could potentially end up while creating additional options 
in between the decisions. I will be able to learn to move, sort, and store players' 
decisions around the code while organizing my code to make 
it as simplistic as it can be. Each decision made by the player will allow me to
dictate if the decision will affect the "Sanity Level"
of the player. Beyond this, this will teach everyone in the world what horror truly is.

## Deliverables
###Skeleton
1. A list of options will be given to the player
2. The player will be able to choose one decision over the other
3. Each decision will output something different
### Basic
1. Create the player's sanity level 
2. Repercussions to the player's decisions affecting the sanity level
3. Ending to all of the player's decisions
###Solid
1. A story is being told to the player
2. The player's decisions will lead to an ending of the game.
3. The ending is meaningful 
4. Player will know if they lose in the game
### Awesome
1. Pictures will show when the story is being told
2. Sound will be played throughout the game
3. Easter eggs will be able to be interacted with to tell back story.
### Beyond
1. Simple animation of the game.
2. Output of the letters is timed and has sound per word.
3. More endings based on very specific decisions.
4. More meaningful decisions in the game.
## Tools
###C++
A language and the only language that I believe I have a good grasp on.

##Possible Problems
The problems that could stand out while making this, will involve the results of the
game being based on the player's sanity level and decisions. 
Sound will probably be an issue to special cases.
